# Kaggle  
This repo contains my attempts on some Kaggle competitions and my exploration of some Kaggle datasets. 

## 1. Bike Share (`bikesharing/`) 

Explored historical usage patterns with weather data in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.. Built basic models to forecast bike rental demand. 

**Keywords:** R, data visualization, regression models 

## 2. Quora Question Pairs (`quora_question/`) (in progress)

Built classification models to classify whether question pairs from Quora are duplicates or not in order to make it easier to find high quality answers to questions. Various features were generated from the question texts and different classification models were evaluated and compared. 

**Keywords:** Python, natural language processing, classification, feature engineering, model tuning, logistic regression, ensemble methods, neural network
